Voice activated music player

Development of a system
Parts:
Arduino Nano Connect PR2040
DFRobot Mini MP3 player + 4Gbyte SD card
NeoPixel Ring (12 Pixels)
Speaker (8 ohm)

This is a system I'm developing for fun, it accepts voice commands then plays music (mp3 files)
I'm using: 

DSpotterSDK_MakerHL.h

NeoPixelConnect.h

I've written my own commands for the MP3 player as the library is too slow and does not offer the commands I'd like to use.
